# LARX Lab Resources Manual Homepage

This Lab manual documents the lab equipment information and the guidance of lab workstations. It also provides some basic background of Linux OS.

The document is still under construction. Any suggestions and contributions are welcomed.



## Lab Resources

All available lab resources and related configurations are introduced in [Basic Information About Lab Resrouces](_pages/basic_lab_info.md).



## User and Group Management

We encourage everyone to create their **own user account** to use workstations instead of the administrator account for the following reasons:

- To avoid potential configuration confusion.
- To keep a clean and tidy server environment for the administrator and all users.
- To provide a better maintenance and update process.
- To ensure the privacy of individual users. 

To create a regular user account for each user, please look at [User Management](_pages/user_management.md). 

We refer to [User Management](_pages/user_management.md) and [Group Management](_pages/group_management.md) for more details about Linux users and groups.
