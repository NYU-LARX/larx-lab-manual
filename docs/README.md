# LARX Lab Resources Manual Homepage

This Lab manual provides the lab equipment information and the guidance of lab workstations. It also provides some basic background of Linux environments.

The document is still under construction. Any type of suggestions and contribution are welcomed.



## Lab Resources

All available lab resources and related configurations are introduced in [Basic Information About Lab Resrouces](_pages/basic_lab_info.md).



## User and Group Management

We encourage everyone to create their own user account to use workstations instead of the administrator account for the following reasons:

- To  avoid potential configuration confusion.
- To keep a clear and tidy server environments for the administrator and all users.
- To provide better updates and maintenance.
- To guarantee the the privacy of the individual user and avoid potential conflict. 

To create a regular user account for each user, please refer to [Create New Users](_pages/create_new_user.md). 

The [User and Group Management](_pages/user_and_group.md) lists more details about Linux users and groups.
