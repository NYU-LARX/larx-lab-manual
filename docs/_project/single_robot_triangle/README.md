# Single Robot Triangle Formation Control

This project studies how to manipulate turtlebot to form a equilateral triangle with a fixed obstacle and a human. 

The turtlebot is eqipped with Lidar which can give distance and angle information of the obstacle and human. We aim to design a controller with Lidar to achieve the objective.

Description of directories:
- `code`: stores the MATLAB simulation code.
- `plots`: stores plots related to the project.
