# Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is software that manages different Python environments for different projects. It was initially designed for learning and statistics analysis. Anaconda is similar to a well-configured Python virtual environment. Users can download and manage Python packages easily via Anaconda without causing conflicts with the system Python packages.

### Installation
Download Anaconda from the [Download Page](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Then, double-click the application and follow the installation instructions. We recommend installing Anaconda in the `/home/username/opt/anaconda` directory.


### Start Anaconda

We can start Anaconda by typing 
```bash
$ anaconda-navigator
```

A graphic UI can help us to configure the conda environment. Anaconda is also well supported in *PyCharm*. Users familiar with *Pycharm* can select a conda environment to run their Python project.
