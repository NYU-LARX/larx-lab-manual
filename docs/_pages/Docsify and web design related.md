## Docsify and web design related

A recommended docsify tutorial: [DocsifyJS Tutorial](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/docsify-js-tutorial/#/?id=docsifyjs-tutorial-homepage)

Official tutoral: [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/)



Docsify maily have four themes, which are taken from other open source project such as vue.

Main components of a *Docsify* site:

- cover page
  - Optional.
  - Landing page with background color or image and some minimal text.
- homepage
  - First page that a user sees, after the cover page. This is a content page written in markdown and it could be the only page of your site if you like. Usually the content in the file `README.md`.
- index page
  - HTML file base of the app.
  - This includes JS and CSS calls for setting up and styling the *Docsify* app. Plus JS code which you set to customize the app.
- sidebar config
  - Optional.
  - Describes the menu layout for the **left sidebar**, using custom ordering and nested structure. *Docsify* is not aware of directory structure, so this is where you get to define your menu. Alternatively, let *Docsify* create the menu bar based on the structure of your homepage (`_docs/README.md`) file - this works best if you only have a single content markdown page or a *navbar* (top of the screen) to switch between sections.
- navbar config
  - Optional.
  - Describes the menu layout for the **top right menu**.

There are some configurations we can make:

- `homepage`: we can designate specific file as the homepage.
- `_sidebar.md`: if we allow sidebar in `index.html`, this means we overwrite the default sidebar generated by docsify with the file `_sidebar.md`. If we disable sidebar in `index.html`, the default sidebar is generated using the title in `home.md`. If we allow sidebar, the sidebar becomes self-defined content in `_sidebar.md`.
- Pay attention to links and reference within `\docs` directory.
- If we allow coverpage, then `/` will become the coverpage directory. `/home` is the home directory.



### About interal reference

Suppose we have the following structure:

```
.
└── docs
    ├── README.md
    ├── guide.md
    └── mydir
        ├── README.md
        └── guide.md
```

We set `homepage: 'README.md'`, and we want to reference `guide.md`, `mydir/guide.md` in `README.md`. How should we write the links in `.md` file?

- Internal links can be relative path, with respect to `docs`. So the path of `guide.md` can be simply `guide.md` with no prefix.
- A markdown link can reference another `.md` file as a whole. In `README.md`, we can write `[guide_link](guide.md)` and `[mydir_guide_link](mydir/guide.md)` to reference two different files.
- Since each `.md` files has titles, we may reference `h1` title such as `[guide_h1](guide.md#h1_title)`, but such `h1` title cannot have space. For example, we cannot write `[guide_h1](guide.md#h1 title)`. It is not common to reference a section in another `.md` file.
- It is common to reference a section or subsection **within** a `.md` file. For example, in `README.md`, we have a section `intro` and `background`, we want to reference `intro` in `background`, we can simply write `[intro_link](#intro)`.

**Note:** Github automatically parses anchor tags out of your headers.  Although `My Multi Word Header` is a `h3` header, it can still generate an anchor tag with the name `my-multi-word-header`. Just one `#` for **all heading sizes**, no space between `#` and anchor name, **anchor tag names must be lowercase, and delimited by dashes if multi-word**.

### HTML basics

[Tutorial for HTML](https://html.com/)

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language in which most websites are written.

CSS is the style or the configuration files for HTML. Without CSS files, we have to write the configurations in `.html` file, which makes the file hard to read and manage.

A **Markup Language** is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and **attributes**.



### HTML tags and attritubes

Tags are used to **mark up the start of an HTML element** and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: `<h1>`. A tag must be closed with `<\h1>` in order to function.

Attributes contain **additional pieces of information**. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is **placed inside**.

Some frequently used tags: `<head>, <body>, <link>,<div>, <meta>, <script>`.



### Web server

Two related programming languages when developing websites: php and JavaScript. The major difference is that php is end-based while JavaScript is client based.

When developing a web server, php is the programming language that runs on the server side. It is response for the request sent by users and necessary computations and operations run by the server. php can be embedded into HTML file. JS is for the user interaction, which can be also embeded into HTML file. Then are mainly written for the browser such google chrome. In this way, the browser itself can do some computation so that the browser does not send every request to the server to let the server compute. This helps to reduce the visit traffic.

Therefore, php and JS are for **back-end** and **front-end** respectively.

For back-end, we may need database and more complex operations. php has abundant libraries to support access database and so on.

### Miscellaneous

`index.html` is the default page for a website's home page. A webserver returns to a visitor if the visitor dees not specify the page he wants to visit. For example, typing a URL such as www.computerglossary.com is the same as entering www.computerglossary.com/index.html. 

Other defalut name: `default.html`, `home.html`. **You Should Have an index.html Page in All Your Directories**.

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTPS is basically an HTTP protocol with additional security.

The information with the regular HTTP protocol that flows from server to browser is not encrypted, which means it can be *easily stolen*. HTTPS protocols remedy this by using an **SSL (secure sockets layer) certificate**, which helps create a secure encrypted connection between the server and the browser.
